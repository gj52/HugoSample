## What to find here? 
Should work with the latest Hugo version (*give me some days*).

- started with the ARIA theme, but changed it mostly - don't compare it.
- changed CSS to **tachyons** - see /links
- changed the main layout to grid and made it responsive 
- added photo / gallery with the help of **fancybox** see /links
- added photo / panorama with help of **OpenSeaDragon** see /links
- added own taxonimy templates for **tags** and **series**
- added local search - thanks to http://tanjabecker.de/
- added MathJax for using math formulas
- added hook renders for images, header and links - see _default/_markup
- image renderer generates different sizes (srclist) and embedded preview
- added feeds: RSS, ATOM and JSON
- using different outputFormats for feeds, search, sitemap etc..
- splitted config for site and theme
- adding light and dark theme 

OK, most content is in German, but this does not matter to see how it works.
Sometimes I verify the generated files (HTML, XML, JSON etc..) to have correct outputs.
